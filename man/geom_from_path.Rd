\usage{
geom_from_path(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  stat = "identity",
  position = "identity",
  ...,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = FALSE,
  inherit.aes = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}} or
\code{\link[ggplot2:aes_]{aes_()}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, as a string.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to [ggplot2::layer()]. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value. See the below
section "Aesthetics" for a full list of possible arguments.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:borders]{borders()}}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 layer ([ggplot2::layer()]) that can be added to a plot
  created with [ggplot2::ggplot()].
}
\description{
This geom is used to plot MLB images instead
  of points in a ggplot. It requires x, y aesthetics as well as a path.
}
\section{Aesthetics}{

`geom_mlb_logos()` understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in bold):
\itemize{
  \item{**x**}{ - The x-coordinate.}
  \item{**y**}{ - The y-coordinate.}
  \item{**path**}{ - a file path, url, raster object or bitmap array. See [`magick::image_read()`] for further information.}
  \item{`alpha = NULL`}{ - The alpha channel, i.e. transparency level, as a numerical value between 0 and 1.}
  \item{`colour = NULL`}{ - The image will be colorized with this colour. Use the special character `"b/w"` to set it to black and white. For more information on valid colour names in ggplot2 see <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html?q=colour#colour-and-fill>}
  \item{`angle = 0`}{ - The angle of the image as a numerical value between 0° and 360°.}
  \item{`hjust = 0.5`}{ - The horizontal adjustment relative to the given x coordinate. Must be a numerical value between 0 and 1.}
  \item{`vjust = 0.5`}{ - The vertical adjustment relative to the given y coordinate. Must be a numerical value between 0 and 1.}
  \item{`width = 1.0`}{ - The desired width of the image in `npc` (Normalised Parent Coordinates).
                          The default value is set to 1.0 which is *big* but it is necessary
                          because all used values are computed relative to the default.
                          A typical size is `width = 0.1` (see below examples).}
  \item{`height = 1.0`}{ - The desired height of the image in `npc` (Normalised Parent Coordinates).
                           The default value is set to 1.0 which is *big* but it is necessary
                           because all used values are computed relative to the default.
                           A typical size is `height = 0.1` (see below examples).}
